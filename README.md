# Hafsat-Website-Sales-Analysis
Hafsat Signature Ventures is a promising fashion brand that focuses on creating handmade bags and fashion accessories that combine beauty with durability and functionality. Founded in 2019, the brand has quickly gained recognition for its unique designs and commitment to quality.

In January 2022, Hafsat Signature Ventures launched its ecommerce website hafsatsignature.com, providing customers with a convenient platform to purchase their products online. Using Python-based visualization tools, I analyzed the sales performance for Hafsat Signature from January to December 2022, providing insights into customer behavior, product performance, and marketing strategies.

## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing the sales data from the Hafsat Signature Ventures ecommerce website using Python. The goal was to provide insights and recommendations that could help Hafsat Signature Ventures optimize their sales performance.. The following steps were taken:

Data collection: The data was collected by manually downloading CSV reports from the websiteâ€™s backend. These reports included useful data such as product sales, customer information, and purchase dates.

Data cleaning: The data was cleaned using Python, including renaming columns, creating new columns, and converting data types where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The cleaned data was analyzed using Python, including creating various visualizations to explore trends and patterns in the data.

Sales dashboard: A sales dashboard was created using Python's Matplotlib library, which allows for visualizations of the sales data.

## More Information
I wrote an article on Medium that provides more detailed information on how I turned the data analysis results into a cool sales dashboard in Python, which you can check out [here](https://app.daily.dev/posts/eku7U2Pm0). This article was picked and published in Daily.dev, which is a great platform for developers to share their work and get feedback from a community of like-minded individuals. In the article, I explain how I designed the dashboard, how I integrated it with the sales data EDA. If you're interested in learning how to create similar dashboards for your own data analysis projects, this article is definitely worth checking out
